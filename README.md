XER READER , a free Primavera viewer, is an Excel Macro that reads an xer and : 

- Generate Project statistics.

- Draw a Gantt chart grouped by WBS

- Generate S curve Based on Duration (Actual and Forecast) ( experimental )

- [Print Calendars.](https://www.plannertuts.com/primavera-p6-calendar-print/)


- Print a WBS split [by level](https://www.plannertuts.com/how-to-import-wbs-from-excel-to-primavera-p6-using-the-sdk/).

- [Generate Some DCMA 14 metrics.](https://www.plannertuts.com/xer-reader-free-tool-run-dcma-14-point-checks/)     


I added a new file, it is using only PowerQuery, it is slower compared to VBA when parsing the XER but once the data is loaded into the
data Model, the rest is very easy. works only with Excel 2013 

I am trying now to redo the whole thing in [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjkwZTMyY2EtYTE1Ny00OWQzLWJlZDktNjkxN2JkOTA3ZmIxIiwidCI6ImI2ZWM3ZGYwLTc1ZGEtNDc2Ni04MGI0LWNlYzM1MzZlNGYzYSIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D)
